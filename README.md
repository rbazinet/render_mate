RenderMate
==============

Allows the user to have true rendering of web pages.  

RenderMate is a gem to accompany the rendermate.com web service.  Please request 
an API key if you would like to try the service.

The problem facing simple screen scrapers is the amount of JavaScript used today.  
When page is accessed there maybe dynamic content being generated and return to the
browser via JavaScript.  RenderMate returns all the native content.

Requirements
-----------------

I test on Ruby 1.9.3.  Let me know if you experience issues with a different version.


Installation
-----------------

   gem install render_mate


Getting Started
-----------------

Once you have an API key, getting started is easy.
